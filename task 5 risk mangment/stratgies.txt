2)suppliers reject to work with us:-                         avoid       "sign a contract with rules of termination"

3)delays in approval from client:-                           mitigate    "communication plans"

4)app crashes after release:-                                avoid       "high load testing before release"

5)bad feedbacks and reviews:-                                avoid       "soft release to find and fix bugs,community survey"

8)team member decide to quit:-                               avoid       "regular reviews, building a friendly working enviroment"

9)team member gets sick:-                                    accept      "ask another developer for a part time work to cover up for his team mate"
